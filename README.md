# mc-telegram

Super simple Telegram bot responding with who is currently playing on a Minecraft server.

## Running

Bot is meant to be ran on Vercel. You only need to register a new TG bot with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and set correct variables for the deployment using a sample in `sample.env`.
